This is a theme for the blogging framework [Octopress](https://github.com/imathis/octopress) that is based on [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).

### It was extracted from my [blog](https://github.com/barmstrong/blog) and looks like this:

Since it's just regular bootstrap you can of course add any bootstrap theme now (such as [bootswatch.com](http://bootswatch.com/) or [wrapbootstrap.com](http://wrapbootstrap.com/)) and it should just!

### To Do

Feel free to fork and submit back pull requests.

* It's still a bit rough around the edges, could use some cleanup (there may be some stuff that is specific to my site in there)
* Unfortunately Bootstrap uses Less and Octopress uses Sass, so for right now I've just included plain CSS from bootstrap.  This works fine but ideally down the road it would use a forked Sass version of bootstrap or modify Octopress to include Less support.  One caveat is that it should ideally still work with the free bootstrap themes such as [bootswatch.com](http://bootswatch.com/).  So there may be some happy combination here.
